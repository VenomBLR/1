# Single Page Application: Employee Reimbursement System

	Congratulations on completing project 0!  Project 1 will be continuation of the work you completed in project 0.  For this project, we will be using the established server, updated to resolve any existing issues, as the backend to a newly added Single Page Application.
	This single page application should implement a full UI for interacting with all API endpoints.
	Technology specification:
	

#   Plain HTML/CSS/JS
# 	ReactJS
# 	UI/UX Considerations
# 	Should be styled â€“ does not need to be beautiful, but some effort should go into this
# 	Intuitive Design
# 	Consistent Design
# 	Good Feedback
# 	If errors occur, make sure that the user is properly notified how to resolve it
# 	Server
# 	If any errors or weaknesses are discovered in the existing API they should be resolved
# 	Revisit security vulnerabilities as necessary
