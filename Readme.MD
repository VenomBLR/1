# Single Page Application: Employee Reimbursement System

	Congratulations on completing project 0!  
	Project 1 will be continuation of the work you completed in project 0.  
	For this project, we will be using the established server, updated to resolve any existing issues,
	as the backend to a newly added Single Page Application.
	This single page application should implement a full UI for interacting with all API endpoints.
